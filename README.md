# 🧬 RNA-seq Pipeline for Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL)

This repository contains a complete RNA-seq data analysis pipeline tailored for the study of **Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL)**, focusing on differential gene expression between endometrial and placental tissues from affected patients and healthy controls.

## 🧪 Study Background

Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL) is a complex reproductive disorder with both genetic and environmental factors. This pipeline was designed to identify **differentially expressed genes (DEGs)** from RNA-seq data of **endometrial** and **placental** tissues in RPL patients compared to controls. The goal is to uncover candidate genes or pathways potentially contributing to the pathology.

## ⚙️ Pipeline Overview

The analysis pipeline is modular and includes the following steps:

1. **Quality Control & Preprocessing**

   * Input: Raw count matrix (e.g., from STAR or featureCounts)
   * Filtering lowly expressed genes
   * Sample annotation and grouping

2. **Normalization & DEG Analysis**

   * Using `DESeq2` for normalization and differential gene expression
   * Comparisons:

     * RPL vs Control (endometrium)
     * RPL vs Control (placenta)
     * Cross-tissue comparisons

3. **Visualization**

   * PCA for sample clustering
   * Volcano plots
   * MA plots
   * Heatmaps of top DEGs

---

## 📦 Key Packages Used

* `DESeq2`
* `ggplot2`
* `pheatmap`
* `EnhancedVolcano`
* `ggrepel`
* `FactoMineR` & `factoextra` (for PCA)

---

## 📈 Example Output

Here are a few examples of figures generated by this pipeline:

* 📊 **Volcano Plot**: Visualizes DEGs with fold change and significance.
* 🔥 **Heatmap**: Expression pattern of top 50 DEGs across all samples.
* 🧭 **PCA Plot**: Shows separation of RPL and control samples based on gene expression.

Plots are available in the `Figures/` directory.

## ▶️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sayed1Zahin/RNA-seq-pipeline-RPL.git
   cd RNA-seq-pipeline-RPL
   ```

2. Open R or RStudio and run the scripts in sequence:

   ```R
   source("Scripts/01_data_preprocessing.R")
   source("Scripts/02_deseq2_analysis.R")
   source("Scripts/03_visualizations.R")
   ```

3. Output tables will be stored in `Data/`, and plots in `Figures/`.
